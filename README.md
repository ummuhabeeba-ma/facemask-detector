Wearing face masks is essential to prevent the spread of airborne diseases. Ensuring compliance with mask-wearing guidelines in public spaces is crucial for public health. Real-time face mask detection systems can play a significant role in monitoring and enforcing these guidelines, helping to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. This project aims to develop a real-time face mask detection system to monitor mask usage effectively and efficiently.

# Approach
We have utilized the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) algorithm for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection tasks. The YOLOv8 model is known for its ability to perform object detection tasks quickly and accurately, making it suitable for real-time applications.

# Data Collection
The dataset was collected from various mask datasets available on Kaggle. The training set includes over 1140 images categorized into two classes:

* With Mask
* Without Mask

# Results
The model achieved a training accuracy of 93.2%, indicating its strong capability in classifying mask usage. This performance suggests that the model is well-trained and reliable for real-time applications.
